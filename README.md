# Color-paletto-chan

this is just a demo project in I  failed miserably in deployment for using old dependencies  ( the CSS broke in the production )
##### Here is the link of the broken demo project  [Demo site](https://color-paletto-chan.netlify.app/)

still if u want to use it😁 feel free 
* First u need to clone it then 
### install dependencies    
```bash
npm i
```
## Start development server
```bash
npm start 
```
